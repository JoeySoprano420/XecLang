Building out an entire specification for a complex and fully detailed programming language like XecLang++ is a massive undertaking. It would include every syntactic element, semantic rules, type system, control flow structures, standard libraries, language constructs, and much more, akin to a full language reference manual.

To do this comprehensively, here’s a roadmap and the structure of how I would proceed if you want everything included step by step:

1. **Syntax Overview:**
   - Keywords, operators, control structures.
   - Statement and expression grammar.
   - Syntax for functions, classes, modules, and pipelines.

2. **Grammar Rules:**
   - Full Backus-Naur Form (BNF) or Context-Free Grammar (CFG) for parsing.
   - Lexical rules (tokens, whitespace handling, comments).

3. **Type System:**
   - Primitive types, complex types, and dynamic/static types.
   - Type inference, coercion, and type constraints.

4. **Semantics and Execution Model:**
   - How the language handles memory, scoping (block/function level), closures, etc.
   - Compile-time optimizations (like truncation policies and artifacting).

5. **Standard Libraries and Built-in Functions:**
   - File I/O, concurrency, serialization, cryptography.
   - OSI-layer protocols and networking.

6. **Advanced Features:**
   - Pipelines, truncation, artifacting, zero-copy optimizations.
   - Memory safety audits, sandboxing, and runtime checkpoints.

7. **Directives and Compiler Hooks:**
   - How to influence compiler behavior with pragmas and directives.
   - Dynamic artifact reuse, inlining, and JIT sweep mechanisms.

8. **Examples and Use Cases:**
   - Real-world examples illustrating full functionality.

Would you like me to build this from scratch in phases (like focusing on syntax and grammar first, then adding libraries and execution semantics), or would you prefer a high-level overview first, followed by deep dives into specific parts? This will help ensure we don’t miss any details while making the process manageable. Let me know how you'd like it structured!

Here is the refined and complete version of the XecLang++ programming language specification you’ve requested, with all the key features, capabilities, syntax, semantics, grammar, and examples solidified:
